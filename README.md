Drishti first establishes a secure connection between care reciever and care taker.
The care taker designates a geofence around a loaction that care receiver resides in. 
If the care receiver ever exists the designated area, care takers are immediately notified through the app.For health monitoring the normal values of a person's heartbeat rate and temperature are recorded on the application itself.
It is further interfaced with sensors that keep on collecting these health parameters. This raw data collected by sensors is compared to the recorded values on app, in case of major deviations the care taker is notified.

A help button is present on the care receiver side that alarms the care taker in case of emergency, when pressed.
